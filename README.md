# RWFD_HR_ATTRITION
As the Head of HR, this comprehensive dataset from DataWorld's Real World Fake Data provides valuable insights into the factors driving attrition within our company. Our investigation aims to identify the key drivers of attrition and develop strategies to mitigate employee turnover.

The first dashboard highlights attrition across a primary set of key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling us to gain a holistic view of the problem. It provides a clear understanding of attrition trends and helps us identify areas of concern. The second dashboard focuses on a secondary set of KPIs, providing additional insights into attrition patterns and allowing us to delve deeper into specific areas of interest. 

These indicators on a scale of 1 to 4 or 5, with 1 indicating a low rating and 4/5 indicating a high rating, we can prioritize our efforts and allocate resources effectively.

With this robust HR attrition dataset and the comprehensive insights derived from the dashboards, we are equipped to make informed decisions and implement targeted retention strategies to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover.
