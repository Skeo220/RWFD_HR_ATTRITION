# RWFD_HR_ATTRITION
## Data Description
[This dataset](https://sonsofhierarchies.com/2022/03/14/real-world-fake-data-season-2/), obtained from DataWorld's Real World Fake Data series, is a valuable resource that provides deep insights into the factors influencing attrition within our company.

## Project summary
Our investigation is focused on identifying the primary drivers of attrition and devising effective strategies to mitigate employee turnover. To achieve this goal, we have developed two comprehensive dashboards that shed light on the attrition trends and offer a holistic view of the problem.
The first dashboard presents attrition data across a primary set of key performance indicators (KPIs), offering a clear understanding of the overall attrition patterns and highlighting areas of concern. Meanwhile, the second dashboard explores a secondary set of KPIs, providing additional insights into attrition patterns and allowing us to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.
The indicators are rated on a scale of 1 to 4 or 5, with 1 indicating low impact and 4/5 indicating high impact. This rating system enables us to prioritize our efforts and allocate resources efficiently.
With access to this robust HR attrition dataset and the comprehensive insights derived from the dashboards, we are well-equipped to make informed decisions and implement targeted retention strategies to enhance employee engagement and reduce turnover effectively.
